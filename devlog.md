# DEVLOG - 3/9/205 9:08 PM

# Project Overview
Right now there are still a lot of aspects of the project that I am not sure of. I know that I need to create a logger, encyption program and driver. The logger will take care of "documentation" throughout the program to see what has been occuring. The encrpytion program will encrypt and decrpyt different words given by the user. The driver program connects these to programs by using pipes to connect their inputs and outputs. It will also provide a menu to be easily understood to the user what action they need to take.

# Plan of Action
I think that the first thing that I want to do is see if I can get the encyption program working. I think that this part of the program shouldn't be too hard to implement once I understand how the cipher works. It seems like the easiest starting point for now because I don't have to deal with connecting different programs through pipes yet. Once I am sure that the encryption program works, I plan to tackle the driver. I don't think that it would make sense to do the logger before doing the driver. This is probably where I will struggle the most just because I sometimes struggle with the creation of pipes. Then, I will focus on the logger last, most likely. However, that's just my plan for now and I will update the devlog once I actually start working on the different aspects of the project. 


For this session, I just hope to set up my devlog succesfully and integrate it with GitHub just for easier interfacing. I also want to get most of the encrpytion file done. I am consulting Rosetta Code to see if they have reference code for the Vigenere cypher rather than completing starting from scratch. Then, I will figure out how to handle the different commands passed as standard inputs and how to handle them.

I am done with my session for today. I think that I was able to get the encryption file fully running. It was pretty straightforward. I was able to find inspiration for the cipher code on Rosetta Code which was the part that helped me the most. From that, the rest of the program only really consists of taking in standard input and performing different actions based on it, which I just implemented as if statements. I was able to accomplish the goal that I wanted to for this session. I think that next time, I will get started on the driver file. For this, my main concern is just figuring out how to structure the pipes so that they correctly connect to each file. That's the main thing that I want to get figured out and I think that it should be a more straightforward process from that point.

Last time, I was able to get most of the encryption file working but that was without having to connect it to any pipes and correctly create the multiple processes. This is the part that I'm most nervous about having to do because I remember having to do this in prior classes and it was always very difficult making that all of the input and ouputs are piped to the correct places. I have also never had to do this in Python, so it will also be a learning how to do this for the first time. However, I chose to do the project in Python because it's the lanaguage that I'm most familiar with when just using a single process. I think that my plan of action for this part is to look at the example code that Prof Salazar gave up regarding the CPU and memory. I'm hoping that this will be a good example of figuring out how to correctly create the pipes and link them together across the different files. So, I think that I'll be working on multiple files for today but it's mostly going to be focused on making sure that they can communicate with each properly.

I think that I was able to set up the pipes to communicate between the files properly. It was actually a lot more straightforward than I was expecting, especially doing it in Python rather than doing it in C/C++. I was able to also create the logger.py file and just put some simple code to make sure that there is something for the driver to communicate with. Within the driver, rather than continously having to write to stdin and then flush, I just grouped those two things into a function both for encryption and for logger. For logger, since all you ever do is just write to it and you don't ever have to recieve, all the function does is write and flush the stream. However, from the encryption file, you do have to be able to send the commands and then read back what it said so that function includes reading and it returns to the main function (for now) whatever message encryption.py sent back. I was able to test the pipe set up and make sure that they are communicating properly with each other. I think that next time I will focus on building out the rest of the driver and making sure that all of the things that it needs to do are done properly. I have to go back and read exactly what it needs to do next time so that I can build it properly. I feel a lot better now that I was able to set up the pipes between the files. I do still need to test my code on cs1 server rather than just locally. I have been running it through my command prompt and not just in VSCode, so I am hoping it will be okay but I do still need to test it to make 100% sure that it works.

Okay, today I want to see if I can figure out the rest of the logger. I just read the instructions again for the logger and basically I have to be able to print out the time that an action occurred and also the action itself. The action should be pretty easy because that's passed to the logger through the driver. I just have to figure out what methods there are in Python in order to log the current time. Other than that, I think it's just a matter of formatting the text so I don't anticipate it to be too difficult, just a little bit tedious.

# 3/17/2025 8:11 PM
I think I was able to get the logger formatted properly. I just used the datetime module in Pyhon and then formatted it to just include the date and only the hour and minute parts of the time. Then I divided the message sent to the logger so that I could reformat it as '[ACTION]' message. It was pretty straightforward but it just took a little bit to make sure that it looked all right with the spaces and everything. I think that's all that needs to be done for the logger. Next, I'm going to move on to the driver. Mainly, I just wnat to write the function that prints out the menu and also work on recieving the commands and sending it to encrpytion. I'm not gonna add all the error checking until I see if the information is being passed between all the files properly.

# 3/17/2025 8:30 PM
Okay, I think that I am done for today. I was able to get the logger formatted properly and I think the encrpytion file is also done. All that is left is figuring out what the driver does for each of the different commands and when to communicate with the other files. However, I think that is a main part of the whole project so I will work on that once I have a bigger chunk of time to be able to focus on it.
